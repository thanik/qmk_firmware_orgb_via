# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [qmk firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). But this fork introduced unofficial OpenRGB protocol with VIA support.

See [dztech/dz65rgb/keymaps/via_orgb_hybrid](https://github.com/thanik/qmk_firmware_orgb_via/tree/feature/thanik/keyboards/dztech/dz65rgb/keymaps/via_orgb_hybrid) for implementation example to use for your keyboard as I own only this keyboard.

Pull requests are welcome :)
