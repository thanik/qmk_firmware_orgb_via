# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [qmk firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). But this fork introduced unofficial OpenRGB protocol with VIA support.

See dztech/dz65rgb/keymaps/via_orgb_hybrid for implementation example to use for your keyboard as I own only this keyboard.
